# COD-Save-Manipulator
A tool for manipulating Call of Duty savegames. This is a natural evolution of my previous IW/MWX/Ghosts Savegame Fixers, because it has support for virtually all modern CODs outside the Black Ops series, on all platforms, and it detects them all automatically. Just input the save into the program, and it will automatically determine which game it is an on which platform.
